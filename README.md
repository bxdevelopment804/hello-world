# hello-world
Always awkward talking about yourself, right?  So I'm a still-learning self taught programmer, looking for a career change after getting bored with my current profession.  I stumbled across coding after a few career/personality assessments and decided to try it out.  "Trying it out" turned into nights, weekends, and perhaps a lunch break or two being dedicated to working on tutorials or projects.  I've had a blast on this journey over the last few months, and look forward to seeing what's next.

Current Skill Set:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- React
- Redux
- More to come...
